I graduated from Quest University in April of 2016, with a BASc in Liberal Arts and Sciences, with a focus in mathematics. The title of my Keystone Project is "Applying Integer Programming to Employee Scheduling", which was in support of the Question  "How do I optimize the efficiency of a system?"

I am currently working on a MSc in Operations Research, through the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University, in Surrey, BC.
